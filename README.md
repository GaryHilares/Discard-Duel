## What is Discard Duel?
Discard Duel is a game where you have to form a straight with 5 of your cards before your AI opponent does.
- At the start of each turn, you draw until you have 6 cards in your hand.
- Every turn, each player shows 1 card to their opponent, discard it and draw a new one.
- At the end of every third turn, each player declares a number, and their opponents must discard any card with that number on it.
- The first to have cards with 5 consecutive numbers wins!
