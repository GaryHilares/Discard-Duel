## What is Discard Duel?
Discard Duel is a game where you have to form a straight with 5 of your cards before your AI opponent does.
- At the start of each turn, you draw until you have 6 cards in your hand.
- Every turn, each player shows 1 card to their opponent, discard it and draw a new one.
- At the end of every third turn, each player declares a number, and their opponents must discard any card with that number on it.
- The first to have cards with 5 consecutive numbers wins!

### Platforms
- Cross-platform.

### Dependencies
#### Development
- A C++ compiler.

## Installation and usage
In UNIX systems, run `./build.sh` to build the game. If your compiler is not g++ or g++ is not on your PATH, you may have to edit the file to match your compiler's path.
In Windows, you can copy the first part of the command in `./build.sh` into your command prompt or build it manually in other way.
